----  ABOUT LUSH  ----

Lush is a pure Lua module for writing POSIX shell script style
programs in Lua.  (A small number of Lush functions depend on
luaposix.)

Lush is currently experimential.  This means future versions of Lush
may include breaking changes.

[Version 20200211]


----  STRING EXPANSION  ----

Similar to POSIX Shell, Lush supports the expansion of variables
inside of strings.  Variables are prefixed with the dollar sign
character ("$").  For example:

sh 'mkdir $HOME/foo'

In Lush variables are expanded lazily (when a string is used, similar
to GNU Make).  This differs from POSIX Shell where string expansion
occurs immediately (when a string is assigned a value).  Consider the
following Lush example:

local  path  =  '$HOME/foo'    -- path is now '$HOME/foo'
sh 'mkdir $path'               -- the sh() function will expand '$path'

Expansion will look for each variable name in the following three
locations:

First, in the local variable of the "parent function".
Second, in the _ENV of the "parent function".
Finally, in the environment variables of the process.

In the above example, the "parent function" is the function that calls
sh().

During expansion, if a value is found in a local or in _ENV, that
value will itself be expanded.  If a value is found in the
environment, it will not be expanded, as it is assumed that
environment variables are already fully expanded.

Internally, string expansion is performed via the following three
functions:

expand ( v, level, ... )
expand_command ( o, level, ... )
expand_template ( s, level, ... )

level specfies the level on the stack where the expand functions will
look for local variables and for _ENV.  This is similar to the Lua
debug.getinfo() function.  At present, vararg parameters are not used,
but they may be used in a future version of Lush.

level defaults to 1, signifying the function that called expand().

'$$' expands to itself.  Therefore, expand() can be recalled
repeatedly on the same string without ill effect.  In other words:
expand ( s ) == expand ( expand ( s ) ).

When Lush executes a subprocess, '$$' will be collapsed to '$'
immediately prior to execution of the command.  This collapse only
happens once.

Note that an error will be raised if you tail call a function that
expands one or more of its arguments.  A tail call removes the parent
function from the stack.  This makes it impossible for expand() to
find locals and _ENV from parent function.  (Thankfully, Lua does
remember that a tail call occurred.  Therefore, expand() can at least
detect the tail call and raise an error.  Otherwise, the tail call
would silently cause an incorrect expansion.)


----  FUNCTIONS  ----

basename ( path )

  Expand path, then return its final directory or filename.

cap ( command, ... )

  A convenient way to call sh() with both
    .capture = true and .rstrip = true.
  In other words, run command and capture its output.  Return the
    output as a string.  See sh() for details.
  Example usage:  local  ls  =  cap 'ls $path'

cat ( path )

  Expand path, open the file at path, read the file's contents, and
  return the contents as a string.

cat { read_keys=path }

  Expand path, open the file at path, read each line, store the lines
  as keys in a table.  Return the table.

cat { path, write=text }

  Expand path, open the file at path, write text to the file, close
  the file.  Text can be a string or a list of strings.

cat { path, append=text }

  Expand path, open the file at path, append text to the end of the
  file, close the file.  Text can be a string or list of strings.

cd ( path, trace )

  chdir() to path.  If trace is true, echo 'cd  $path' before calling
  chdir().  cd() depends on the posix.unistd module.

cond ( command, ... )

  A convenient way to call sh() with ignore = true.
  Use with if to test if a program exited nnormally.
  See sh() for details.
  Example usage:  if cond '[ -f $path ]' then end

count ( n )

  Use with for to loop from n to infinity.
  Expamle usage:  for n in count (20) do end    -- will start counting at 20

dirname ( path )

  Return path after removing the final '/' and all characters after
  it.

each ( t )

  Use with for to loop over each value in a list.
  Example usage:  for n in each { 1, 3, 5 } do end

echo ( s )

  Expand s as a template and print the expansion.  See
  expand_template() for details.
  (Note: echo()'s expansion method, and therefore its output, is
  likely to change in the future.)

expand ( s, level, ... )

  Expand string s against locals and _ENV from level on the call
  stack.  Return the expanded string.
  The vararg ... is unused at present.

expand_command ( command, level, ... ).

  Expand command against locals and _ENV from level on the call stack.
  Return the expanded command as single string.

  Note: Typically, you do not directly call expand_command().
  Typically, expand_command() is called for you by sh().  However,
  understaing expand_command() will help you reason about command
  expansion.

  Command can be a string.  If command is a string, then command is
  expanded by expand_template().

  Command can be a table (typically, a list).  If the first value in
  the list is a string, that string is expanded by expand_template().
  All other values in the list will be expanded by expand and quoted
  as separate arguments.

expand_template ( template, info )

  Note: Typically, you do not directly call expand_template().
  Typically, expand_command() will call expand_teplate().  However,
  understanding expand_template() can help you reason about command
  expansion.

  template is a string.
  info contains two tables:  The _ENV and a table of scraped locals.

  expand_template() will expand the template against the variables
  contained in info.

  Template expansion is different from normal string expansion as
  follows:

  1) If a string is expanded inside a template, the string will be
  quoted/escaped (only when needed).  [In other words, the child
  process will receive the string as a single argument.]

  2) If a table is expanded inside a template, the table will be
  interpreted as a list.  Each elemment of the list will be expanded
  and quoted as a separated argument.

  The table can be a hierarchical tree of lists.  The tree will be
  flattened into a list of strings.  Each string will be expanded and
  quoted as a separate argument.

  Note: You never need to quote the variables in a template.  Lush
  quotes all templte expansions automatically, if needed.  In fact,
  puting your own quote characters in the template is very likely to
  cause the command to execute incorrectly, as your quotes may
  conflict with the automatically generated quotes.

  Example usage:
  local  b  =  'B'
  local  c  =  'C C'
  expand_template 'a $b $c'  --  will return "a B 'C C'"

export ( s )

  export a value to the environment.  s is a string of the form
  'name=value'.
  Example usage:  export 'foo=$bar'
  export() depends on the posix.stdlib module.

getcwd ()

  Return the current working directory.  Depends on posix.unistd.

glob ( pattern )

  Use with for to iterate over paths that match pattern.
  Exapmle usage:  for path in glob '/tmp/*.txt' do end
  Depends on posix.glob.

in_list ( k, s )

  Returns true if string k is one of the space delimited words in
  string s.
  Example usage:  if in_list ( 'foo', 'fee fi fo fum' ) then end

import ()

  Import common Lush functions into _G.  Return a table of all Lush
  functions (both common and uncommon).
  Example usage:  local lush  =  require 'lush' .import()

is ( s )

  Access the POSIX shell's builtin test command.  This can be used to
  determine if a file or directory exists, and for other purposes.

  Example usage: if is '-f $path' then end

popen ( command, ... )

  A convenient way to call sh() with
    .popen = true and .readlines = true.
  Use with for to iterate over the lines of output of a command.
  See sh() for details.
  Example usage:  for path in popen 'ls' do end

printf ( format, ... )

  io .write ( format : format ( ... ) )

quote ( s )

  Quote string s, allowing it to be passed to a subprocess as a single
  command line argument to that subprocess.  You may never need to
  quote, as sh() automatically quotes all expansions for you.

sh ( command, ... )
sh { command, [arg ... ] [<option>=true ... ] }

  Execute command as a subprocess.

  Command can be a string or a list.

  Command will be turned into a single string by expand_command()

  The command will be executed via os.execute() or io.popen().

  At present, the vararg ... is not used.  This may change in the
  future.  Instead of varag, you can call sh with a table:
    sh { command, arg, arg, arg }

  If command is a table, the following six keys are optional:

  If .capture == true, capture and return the commands output.
  If .capture == true and .rstrip == true, then remove the trailing
    newline character from the command's output before returning the
    command's output.
  If .ignore == true, ignore the exit code of the command.
  If .popen == true, return the result of io.popen().
  If .popen == true and .readlines == true, then return an iterator
    over the lines of command's output.
  If .trace == true, print the command before executing it.

  If command starts with the '-' character, then .ignore will be set
  to true.  For example:  sh '-false'

  Unless .ignore == true, sh() will raise an error if the command
  exits with a non-zero exit status.

  By default sh() will return the values returned by os .execute().
  Meaning, sh() will one of:
    true
    nil, 'exit',   exit_status
    nil, 'signal', signal_number

trace ( command, ... )

  A convenient way to call sh() with .trace = true.


----  COMPATIBILITY  ----

Lush is designed to work with Lua 5.3 and may also work with Lua 5.2.
Lush expects os .execute() to call a POSIX shell.

As documented above, several of Lush's functions depend on the
luaposix module.

Several parts of Lush would need to be modified to work with Lua 5.1.
On Lua 5.1, the results of os .execete() may vary by system.  This
could break Lush's ability to detect whether or not commands executed
successfully.  In Lua 5.1, file:close() does not return the exit
status of a process that was created by io.popen.

Regarding using Lush on Windwos, or on other systems with a non-POSIX
shell, this may work if the quote function is adjusted to properly
quote each argument.  Other unknown adjustments migth also be
required.
